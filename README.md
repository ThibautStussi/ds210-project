Thibaut Stussi | BU CDS DS 210 Final Project

The following is my code (written in Rust) for the project. 
The ds210_hw5 file is for a previous homework assignment on the project, while final_project file is the main file where all the new code is written.
The writeup in the attached pdf explains how to run each function and the results of the data analysis work.

This project analyzes the effect of certain characteristics on the exam score of a student.
The goal of the project is to predict a student's exam score given certain characteristics and understand differences in the data.

Each function call in main.rs under main{} can be edited, but refer back to the project writeup to better understand how to call each function properly.
Make sure to run with cargo run --release as run times are a little long (around 2 minutes)

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors
The dataset is already inside the final_project folder.
